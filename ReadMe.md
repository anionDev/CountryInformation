# CountryInformation

CountryInformation is a project to provide certain country- and language-information in a way which is well processable programmatically.
CountryInformation fully relies on [countries](https://github.com/mledoze/countries) and therefore also uses the same license.
Many thanks to [mledoze](https://github.com/mledoze) for this great project and also many thanks to all contributors of [countries](https://github.com/mledoze/countries) which makes it possible to use the data in a very easy way.

This project provides the country- and language-information in a python-package to be available and usable in your python-scripts.
This project is optimized to provide the country- and language-information in the [RFC-5646](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646)-/[BCP-47](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/BCP_47_language_tag)-format.
