# CountryInformation

CountryInformation is a project to provide certain country- and language-information in a way which is well processable programmatically.
CountryInformation fully relies on [countries](https://github.com/mledoze/countries) and therefore also uses the same license.
Many thanks to [mledoze](https://github.com/mledoze) for this great project and also many thanks to all contributors of [countries](https://github.com/mledoze/countries) which makes it possible to use the data in a very easy way.
